# NextGram

This is a ample [Next.js by ZEIT](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) application
that takes advantage of the advanced routing capabilities.

In particular, note that the photo route can be attached to _two distinct_ components:

1. When navigated within the application, it is rendered as a modal
1. When the page is refreshed, it is rendered independently
